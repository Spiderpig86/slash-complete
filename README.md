# SlashComplete

SlashComplete brings Notion-style Markdown autocompletion to Obsidian, making it easy to insert blocks, commands, and formatting with a simple `/` command. Type `/` in your note and instantly access a palette of quick actions and formatting options, streamlining your note-taking workflow. SlashComplete is meant as a _replacement_ to the existing Notion slash commands plugin to solely focus on Markdown support.

## :sparkles: Features

- **Notion-style Slash Commands:** Type `/` to trigger a contextual autocomplete menu for blocks, formatting, and commands.
- **Markdown Block Insertion:** Quickly insert headings, lists, quotes, code blocks, and more without leaving the keyboard.
- **Customizable Suggestions:** Add or modify slash commands to suit your workflow.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works natively within Obsidian’s editor for a smooth experience.
